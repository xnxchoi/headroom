"""Loop detection for Headroom Learn — find repeated tool-call patterns.

A *loop* is the single highest-value pattern for `headroom learn` to catch,
because its token waste scales with the number of repetitions rather than
being a one-time cost. Two loop shapes matter:

1. **Error loops** — the same call fails, the agent retries, it fails again
   (e.g. a wrong path read N times). Every repetition is pure waste.

2. **Re-fetch loops** — a shell command's output is limited or truncated
   (``grep foo | head -50``). When the limit drops what the agent needed, the
   agent re-runs a *variant* of the same command to fetch more (``head -100``,
   a new offset, a narrower pattern). Each call succeeds (``is_error=False``)
   but returns insufficient output, so the loop is invisible to failure-only
   analysis.

This module collapses such variants to a canonical signature, counts the
repetitions, and measures the wasted tokens so the analyzer can (a) surface
loops to the LLM and (b) weight loop-derived recommendations above one-offs.
The analyzer historically ranked recommendations purely by an LLM-guessed
``estimated_tokens_saved`` with a flat confidence — loops had no special
weight at all.
