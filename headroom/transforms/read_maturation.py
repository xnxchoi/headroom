"""Mechanism B: hold-back Read maturation — compress before cache entry.

The prefix cache bills you for everything *after* the first changed byte,
so mutating an already-cached Read is ruinously expensive — but bytes that
have never been cache-written have no cache entry to bust. This module
exploits the one safe window: a fresh Read is deliberately held *out* of
the provider cache (the trailing cache breakpoint is relocated to just
before it) while its file is active. The model sees the verbatim content
the whole time it is working with the file. Once the file has been quiet
for `quiesce_turns`, the content is replaced with a CCR-backed marker —
and only that final, small form ever enters the cache.

Timeline for a Read of file F (quiesce_turns=5):

    turn T:      model reads F — verbatim, NOT cached
    T+1..T+k:    model edits / re-reads F — read stays verbatim and
                 uncached (every touch resets the quiet clock)
    T+k+5:       F has been quiet 5 turns → read matures into a marker;
                 the breakpoint returns to the tail; the marker form is
                 cache-written once
    later turns: marker form read from cache at the provider discount

Why activity-based instead of a fixed hold window: the audit-reads
simulation over real traffic showed touch gaps are fat-tailed (next-touch
p50 = 4 turns, p90 = 81) — no fixed window covers the tail. The quiesce
rule covers the activity cluster, `max_hold_turns` bounds the hold cost
for pathologically busy files, and the tail self-heals through the
model's *observed* habit of re-reading ranges from disk: 95% of re-reads
in real traffic are partial-range reads made while the full text was
still in context. The recovery path is the model's existing behavior.

Two invariants:

1. **No cached byte is ever mutated.** The verbatim form is never
   cache-written, so maturation invalidates nothing.
2. **Replay is deterministic.** Once matured, the same marker is applied
   on every subsequent request (state is session-scoped), so the cached
   prefix stays byte-stable for the rest of the session.

Recovery contract (same as read_lifecycle): the full original is stored
in the CCR compression store, the marker carries the retrieval hash and
the file path, and the file itself remains on disk — a confused model
re-reads at the cost of one tool call.

State (matured markers only — holding is derived from the conversation
itself, so it survives state loss) lives with the session's prefix
tracker. Per-process, like all session state: multi-worker deployments
need sticky sessions (existing constraint).
