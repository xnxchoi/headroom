"""Per-request backend selection, published by an extension.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    Headroom picks its egress backend ONCE, at startup: `create_proxy_backend`
    returns a single `Backend` (or None for the direct Anthropic path) and
    every request goes through it. That is right for "run this whole proxy
    against Bedrock instead of Anthropic", and it is the wrong shape for "this
    request is cheaper on a different provider than the last one".

    Meanwhile `ModelRouter` already lets an extension change `body["model"]`
    per request -- but only within whatever protocol the request arrived in,
    because a model id alone cannot move a request to another provider.

    So a router extension can currently decide something Headroom has no way to
    carry out. This module is the missing half: a routing decision that names a
    PROVIDER as well as a model, and a per-request backend to serve it.

THE CONTRACT, AND WHY IT IS VENDOR-NEUTRAL
    An extension sets `request.state.headroom_route` to a `RouteAdvice`.
    Headroom reads it, resolves a backend for `advice.provider`, and dispatches
    there. Nothing in core names any particular extension.

ABSENT MEANS UNCHANGED
    This is the property that matters most. With no extension installed, no
    extension setting the field, an unresolvable provider, or a backend that
    fails to construct, `backend_for()` returns exactly what
    `self.anthropic_backend` would have been -- including None, which keeps the
    direct-API path. Nothing about the default deployment moves.
