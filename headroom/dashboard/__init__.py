    r"""Pin the MIME types used for the vendored dashboard assets.

    ``StaticFiles`` derives ``Content-Type`` from :func:`mimetypes.guess_type`,
    and Python seeds that database from the host: the Windows registry
    (``HKCR\<ext>\Content Type``) and, elsewhere, files like
    ``/etc/mime.types``. A host that maps ``.js`` to ``text/plain`` — a stale
    registry entry, or a minimal container image carrying no mime database at
    all — makes the proxy serve ``alpine.min.js`` and its siblings as plain
    text. The proxy also sends ``X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`` on every
    response, so the browser refuses to execute a script labelled that way and
    the dashboard loads unstyled and dataless (#3179).

    Registering the standard mappings makes the served type independent of the
    host database. :func:`mimetypes.add_type` is strict by default, so these
    replace a bad host entry rather than losing to it.

    Called from ``create_app`` rather than at import time: correcting the
    process-wide table is right for the proxy that serves these files, but it
    is not a side effect ``import headroom`` should have on a library consumer.
