# Proxy Server Documentation

The Headroom proxy server is a production-ready HTTP server that applies context optimization to all requests passing through it.

> The proxy exposes compression-as-a-service via the `POST /v1/compress` endpoint — used by the [TypeScript SDK](typescript-sdk.md), LiteLLM's `headroom` guardrail, and gateway sidecars. It is loopback-only by default; see the endpoint section below.

## Starting the Proxy

```bash
# Basic usage
headroom proxy

# Custom port
headroom proxy --port 8080

# With all options
headroom proxy \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8787 \
  --log-file /var/log/headroom.jsonl \
  --budget 100.0
```

### Common agent CLI entrypoints

```bash
# Claude Code
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787 claude

# GitHub Copilot CLI
headroom wrap copilot -- --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# OpenAI-compatible clients
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787/v1 your-app
```

`headroom wrap copilot` uses Copilot CLI's BYOK provider settings under the hood. In `provider-type=auto`, it chooses Headroom's Anthropic route for the default proxy backend and the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` route for translated backends such as `anyllm` and LiteLLM.

Anonymous aggregate telemetry is **off by default** (opt-in). Opt in with `HEADROOM_TELEMETRY=on` or `headroom proxy --telemetry`. Downstream apps can set `HEADROOM_SDK=headroom-app` to override the anonymous telemetry `sdk` label; the default remains `proxy`.

Operational OTEL metrics are configured separately and are **off by default**. Install `headroom-ai[proxy,otel]` and set:

```bash
HEADROOM_OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED=1
HEADROOM_OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp_http
HEADROOM_OTEL_METRICS_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/metrics
HEADROOM_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=headroom-proxy
```

Use `HEADROOM_OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=console` for local smoke testing. `HEADROOM_TELEMETRY` controls the anonymous data-flywheel beacon only; it does not disable or enable OTEL export.

Langfuse can be enabled alongside this OTEL path for **trace ingestion**. Langfuse does **not** ingest OTEL metrics, so Headroom keeps metrics and Langfuse traces as complementary signals:

```bash
HEADROOM_LANGFUSE_ENABLED=1
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

When configured, Headroom emits OTLP traces for the shared compression pipeline to Langfuse while continuing to expose metrics through `/metrics` and OTEL metric exporters.

## Command Line Options

### Core Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Host to bind to |
| `--port` | `8787` | Port to bind to |
| `--mode` | `cache` | Run mode: `token` (maximize compression) or `cache` (freeze prior turns) |
| `--no-optimize` | `false` | Disable optimization (passthrough mode) |
| `--no-cache` | `false` | Disable semantic caching |
| `--no-rate-limit` | `false` | Disable rate limiting |
| `--log-file` | None | Path to JSONL log file |
| `--budget` | None | Daily budget limit in USD |
| `--code-aware` / `--no-code-aware` | disabled | Enable or disable AST-based code compression. Requires `headroom-ai[code]` (env: HEADROOM_CODE_AWARE_ENABLED=1 to enable) |
| `--anthropic-api-url` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Custom Anthropic API URL endpoint |
| `--openai-api-url` | `https://api.openai.com` | Custom OpenAI API URL endpoint |
| `--anthropic-extra-headers` | unset | JSON object of extra headers merged into (and overriding) forwarded Anthropic requests, e.g. `'{"Api-Key": "..."}'` |
| `--openai-extra-headers` | unset | JSON object of extra headers merged into (and overriding) forwarded OpenAI requests |

### Run Modes

Headroom proxy has two explicit run modes:

- `token` mode: prioritize token reduction. Prior history may be rewritten when that improves compression.
- `cache` mode: prioritize provider prefix cache stability. Prior turns are frozen; only the newest turn is mutable.

Set via CLI or env:

```bash
headroom proxy --mode token
HEADROOM_MODE=cache headroom proxy
```

When to pick each:

- `token`: best for maximizing immediate compression savings.
- `cache`: best for long conversations where preserving prior-turn bytes improves prefix-cache reuse.

Legacy values (`token_headroom`, `cost_savings`) are still accepted as aliases.

### Context Management Options

Context management in the proxy is handled automatically by the compression pipeline. CCR (Compress-Cache-Retrieve) ensures that when content is compressed or messages are dropped, the original data remains accessible for the LLM to retrieve on demand. See [CCR documentation](ccr.md) for details.

Key CCR-related proxy flags:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-ccr` | Disable CCR entirely — no retrieval markers in compressed output and no injected `headroom_retrieve` tool (lossy, no recovery path) |
| `--no-ccr-proactive-expansion` | Disable proactive context expansion before the LLM asks |

### ML Compression — RETIRED `--llmlingua` flag

The `--llmlingua` / `--llmlingua-device` / `--llmlingua-rate` flags and
the `headroom-ai[llmlingua]` extra were retired and replaced by Kompress
(ModernBERT). For the current opt-in path, install `headroom-ai[ml]`
and see [transforms.md](transforms.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## API Endpoints

### Liveness

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/livez
```

Response:
```json
{
  "service": "headroom-proxy",
  "status": "healthy",
  "alive": true,
  "version": "0.5.21",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-10T16:36:25Z",
  "uptime_seconds": 12.483
}
```

### Readiness

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/readyz
```

Response:
```json
{
  "service": "headroom-proxy",
  "status": "healthy",
  "ready": true,
  "version": "0.5.21",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-10T16:36:25Z",
  "uptime_seconds": 12.483,
  "checks": {
    "startup": {"enabled": true, "ready": true, "status": "healthy"},
    "http_client": {"enabled": true, "ready": true, "status": "healthy"},
    "cache": {"enabled": true, "ready": true, "status": "healthy"},
    "rate_limiter": {"enabled": true, "ready": true, "status": "healthy"},
    "memory": {"enabled": false, "ready": true, "status": "disabled"}
  }
}
```

`/readyz` returns HTTP 503 when Headroom has not completed startup or a required enabled subsystem is unavailable. This is the endpoint used by the container health checks.

### Aggregate Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ready": true,
  "version": "0.5.21",
  "config": {
    "backend": "anthropic",
    "optimize": true,
    "cache": true,
    "rate_limit": true
  },
  "checks": {
    "startup": {"enabled": true, "ready": true, "status": "healthy"},
    "http_client": {"enabled": true, "ready": true, "status": "healthy"}
  }
}
```

### Detailed Statistics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/stats
```

`/stats` remains the live/session-oriented endpoint and now also includes a
`persistent_savings` block with durable proxy compression lifetime totals plus a
small recent preview. The existing `savings_history` field is still present and
remains session-scoped for backward compatibility.

For providers that return cache-write TTL bucket usage, `/stats` also includes
observed TTL breakdowns under `prefix_cache`:

- `observed_ttl_buckets.5m.tokens`
- `observed_ttl_buckets.1h.tokens`
- `observed_ttl_mix`

These are provider-reported observations, not configured TTL and not remaining
expiration time.

### Historical Savings

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/stats-history
```

`/stats-history` exposes durable proxy compression history for dashboards and
other Headroom frontends. It returns:

- lifetime proxy compression totals
- compact checkpoint history by default, with `history_mode=full` available for
  export/debug flows
- derived hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly rollups for charts
- a `history_summary` block describing stored versus returned checkpoint counts
- UTC timestamps throughout

By default the proxy stores this history at
`${HEADROOM_WORKSPACE_DIR}/proxy_savings.json` (i.e.
`~/.headroom/proxy_savings.json` when `HEADROOM_WORKSPACE_DIR` is unset).
Set `HEADROOM_SAVINGS_PATH` to override the location directly, or set
`HEADROOM_WORKSPACE_DIR` to relocate the full state root. See the
[Filesystem Contract](filesystem-contract.md).

`/dashboard` uses this endpoint directly for its historical view, including the
daily/weekly/monthly rollups and built-in JSON / CSV export buttons.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8787/stats-history?format=csv&series=weekly"
curl "http://localhost:8787/stats-history?format=csv&series=monthly"
curl "http://localhost:8787/stats-history?history_mode=full"
```

### Prometheus Metrics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/metrics
```

`/metrics` remains the built-in Prometheus-formatted operational view. The proxy now also emits the same operational events through the OTEL facade when OTEL metrics are configured.

### LLM APIs

The proxy supports both Anthropic and OpenAI API formats:

```bash
# Anthropic format
POST /v1/messages

# OpenAI format
POST /v1/chat/completions
```

### `POST /v1/compress`

Compression-only endpoint. Compresses messages without ever making a **completion request to an LLM provider** — no generation, no provider API key. Used by the [TypeScript SDK](typescript-sdk.md), LiteLLM's `headroom` guardrail, and gateway sidecars.

**It does run local ML models.** Compression is ML-backed: Kompress is a ModernBERT encoder scoring tokens for retention (classification, not generation) and Magika classifies content types, both in-process by default. If `HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT` is set, Kompress inference is offloaded over HTTP to that model server — real egress from the sidecar. Only inference goes remote; the CCR store and markers stay proxy-local. `HEADROOM_DISABLE_KOMPRESS=1` gives structural compression only.

**Loopback-only by default.** Non-loopback callers get **404** (not 403 — the route stays invisible to scanners). Set `HEADROOM_COMPRESS_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` to allow remote callers.

**No format conversion.** `messages` may be OpenAI-shaped (`role: "tool"` + `tool_call_id`) or Anthropic-shaped (`tool_use` / `tool_result` content blocks); the same shape comes back. `model` selects the tokenizer and context limit — send the real name, including gateway-prefixed forms like `bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet`.

**`system` and `tools` are ignored outside gateway mode.** Anthropic sends both out of band. Without a `gateway` block this endpoint accepts them without complaint (200, no warning) and returns neither, so neither is compressed — keep carrying them yourself. That means the Anthropic system prompt is not compressed here, and tool-schema compaction / tool-search deferral are not reachable this way. Gateway mode (below) passes `tools` through and compacts them; in OSS, native tool-search deferral is still proxy-only — the headroom-tool-search extension adds it to gateway mode as a turn hook.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "messages": [...],          // either wire format
  "model": "gpt-4o",          // tokenizer + context limit
  "token_budget": 8000,       // optional: override the context limit
  "config": {                 // optional
    "mode": "lossy_inline",       // ccr | lossy_inline | lossless_then_lossy
    "frozen_message_count": 12,   // pin an already-cached prefix
    "session_id": "conv-8f1c",    // session mode: Headroom keeps the replay state
    "compress_user_messages": false,
    "target_ratio": 0.5,
    "protect_recent": 2,
    "protect_analysis_context": true
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "messages": [...],            // compressed messages
  "tokens_before": 15000,
  "tokens_after": 3500,
  "tokens_saved": 11500,
  "compression_ratio": 0.23,    // tokens_after / tokens_before — LOWER is better
  "transforms_applied": ["router:smart_crusher:0.35"],
  "transforms_summary": {"router:smart_crusher:0.35": 1},
  "ccr_hashes": [],             // non-empty only with mode="ccr"
  "session": {"id": "conv-8f1c", "frozen_message_count": 12, "cached_prefix_replayed": true}  // session mode only
}
```

**Headers:**
- `x-headroom-bypass: true` — skip compression, return messages as-is with zeroed metrics

**Error responses:** 400 (missing/invalid fields, bad `config.mode`, `config.frozen_message_count` or `config.session_id`, `session_id` with `compress_user_messages`, malformed `gateway` block), 401 (bad `HEADROOM_PROXY_TOKEN`), 404 (non-loopback without `HEADROOM_COMPRESS_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`), 503 (compression failed; in session mode also `compression_timeout` — retry the turn)

**Fail-open:** without a session, on timeout you get 200 with the original messages plus `compression_skipped: true` and `skip_reason: "compression_timeout"`. In session mode a timeout or busy session lock is a 503 instead, because handing back originals would desync the replay state.

**Multi-turn callers — don't lose the prefix cache.** Without `config.session_id` this endpoint is stateless: unlike the proxy's own request path (which runs a CacheAligner and tracks provider cache hits across turns), it has no idea what the provider already cached. Either let Headroom keep the state (session mode, below) or keep it yourself with `frozen_message_count`.

The provider caches the bytes you *forwarded*, which compression already changed — so your originals and the cached prefix are no longer the same thing, and it is the forwarded version you must keep reproducing. Compression also varies with position: an older tool result can fall outside the recent-read protection window as the conversation grows and be compressed harder than last turn, so re-compression is not guaranteed to reproduce earlier output either. Two rules:

1. Pass `config.frozen_message_count` = the number of leading messages already cached upstream.
2. Send back the messages you **previously forwarded**, not the pristine originals. `frozen_message_count` returns leading messages exactly as passed in, so feeding it originals hands the provider different bytes than last turn and busts the cache anyway.

```python
forwarded = []


def next_turn(new_messages):
    r = requests.post(
        f"{proxy}/v1/compress",
        json={
            "messages": forwarded + new_messages,
            "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
            "config": {"frozen_message_count": len(forwarded)},
        },
    ).json()
    forwarded[:] = r["messages"]  # next turn's frozen prefix
    return forwarded
```

Note `protect_recent` is not a substitute — it guards the newest messages, while `frozen_message_count` guards the oldest, which is the cached end.

**Session mode.** Pass `config.session_id` (non-empty, at most 256 chars) and Headroom keeps the conversation's replay state itself — the same per-session compression cache and prefix tracker the proxy uses — so a gateway that owns routing can resend the raw conversation every turn and get a byte-identical prefix back. Everything previously returned for the session comes back unchanged; only the new tail is compressed; an explicit `frozen_message_count` still wins when larger. Forward the returned messages verbatim. `compress_user_messages` is refused (400). State is in-process (replay cache: `HEADROOM_COMPRESSION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, default 3900; tracker state: 10 idle minutes), so multi-process deployments must pin a session to one process. `HEADROOM_COMPRESS_SESSION_FROM_HEADER=1` lets the `x-headroom-session-id` header stand in for `config.session_id` (off by default).

Optionally relay the provider's usage for attribution with `POST /v1/usage` `{"session_id": "...", "usage": {...}}`. Anthropic `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` and OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` / flat `cached_tokens` are accepted; a block with none of them is a 400. Replies `{"session_id", "frozen_message_count", "applied"}` (`applied: false, reason: "no_cache_signal"` when the only present field is 0), 404 `unknown_session`, or 503 `session_busy` (retry). Telemetry only — it never raises the frozen count.

**Gateway mode (two-half turn contract).** Add a top-level `gateway` object (`{}` is enough) and one model turn becomes two calls, so a gateway that never lets Headroom see the provider response can still run transforms whose reload step needs it — the proxy's "no shrink without reload" rule at the API boundary. `gateway` fields: `can_redrive` (default `false`: the gateway can call the provider again with a request Headroom hands it; send `false` when streaming), `can_relay_response` (default `false`: the gateway will post status/usage after each turn), `session_affinity` (default `true`; `false` disables re-driving because pending turns are in-process), `plugin_version` (diagnostics). Every other top-level field (`system`, `tools`, `temperature`, …) passes through; `tools` is compacted deterministically (`tool_schema_compaction`; `tool_desc_compaction` with `HEADROOM_TOOL_DESC_MAX_CHARS`); extension turn hooks run, stream-safe-only unless `can_redrive` and `session_affinity` both hold. The response adds `body` (the complete provider request — forward it as-is; never contains `config`, `gateway`, `token_budget`), `turn_id`, `route` (`{model, provider, service_tier, reason}`, advisory; a routing extension's model is also written into `body.model`), `obligations` (`redrive` and/or `relay_usage`) and a `gateway` echo. Fail-open answers carry the same keys with originals and `obligations: []`. A turn is registered only when `obligations` is non-empty; with `relay_usage` the `/stats` record waits for the response half. Knobs: `HEADROOM_GATEWAY_TURN_TTL_SECONDS` (120), `HEADROOM_GATEWAY_MAX_PENDING_TURNS` (10000), `HEADROOM_GATEWAY_MAX_REDRIVES` (8). With `config.mode: "ccr"` and re-drive allowed, `headroom_retrieve` is injected into `body.tools` (`ccr_tool_injected`) and the response half answers the model's retrieval calls itself.

`POST /v1/compress/response` (same exposure rules as `/v1/compress`) is the response half: `{"turn_id", "status": 200, "latency_ms", "usage": {...}, "response": {...}}`. `usage` accepts Anthropic, OpenAI chat (`prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`), OpenAI Responses (`input_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) and Kong's flat `cached_tokens` shapes, or the whole provider body (a nested `usage` key is descended into once); billed counters are summed across re-drive rounds. `response` is required when the turn carries `redrive`. Answers: `{"action": "done", "turn_id", "response": <replacement or null — forward what you hold>, "frozen_message_count", "usage_applied", "rounds"}` or `{"action": "redrive", "turn_id", "request": <full provider body to send>, "round"}` — post the provider's JSON back under the same `turn_id`; past `HEADROOM_GATEWAY_MAX_REDRIVES` the turn ends with `done` and `response: null`. Errors: 400 `invalid_request` / `missing_response`, 404 `unknown_turn` (unregistered, finished, or expired), 409 `turn_busy`.

**Kong plugin.** [kong-plugin-headroom](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/kong-plugin-headroom) (its own repo; `luarocks install kong-plugin-headroom`) implements both halves for Kong Gateway 3.9 (session id from a header, usage relay from the `log` phase, re-drive loop in `access`). The contract itself is installed in Headroom through the compress-turn seam (`headroom.proxy.compress_turn`, `HEADROOM_GATEWAY_CONTRACT`), the same seam a third-party contract would use.

## Using with Claude Code

```bash
# Start proxy
headroom proxy --port 8787

# In another terminal
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787 claude
```

## Using with Cursor

1. Start the proxy: `headroom proxy`
2. In Cursor settings, set the base URL to `http://localhost:8787`

## Using with OpenAI SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8787/v1",
    api_key="your-api-key",  # Still needed for upstream
)
```

## Features

### ML Compression (Opt-In, Kompress)

> The earlier LLMLingua-2 integration documented in this section
> (`--llmlingua`, `--llmlingua-device`, `--llmlingua-rate`,
> `headroom-ai[llmlingua]`, `LLMLinguaCompressor`) was retired and
> replaced by **Kompress** (ModernBERT). Install with `pip install
> 'headroom-ai[ml]'`. See [transforms.md](transforms.md) and
> [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for current configuration.

### Semantic Caching

The proxy caches responses for repeated queries:

- LRU eviction with configurable max entries
- TTL-based expiration
- Cache key based on message content hash

### Rate Limiting

Token bucket rate limiting protects against runaway costs:

- Configurable requests per minute
- Configurable tokens per minute
- Per-API-key tracking

### Cost Tracking

Track spending and enforce budgets:

- Real-time cost estimation
- Budget periods: hourly, daily, monthly
- Automatic request rejection when over budget

### Prometheus Metrics

Export metrics for monitoring:

```
headroom_requests_total
headroom_tokens_saved_total
headroom_cost_usd_total
headroom_latency_ms_sum
```

## Configuration via Environment

```bash
export HEADROOM_HOST=0.0.0.0
export HEADROOM_PORT=8787
export HEADROOM_BUDGET=100.0

# Route OpenAI passthrough requests to a custom endpoint
export OPENAI_TARGET_API_URL=https://custom.openai.endpoint.com

# Route Anthropic passthrough requests to a custom endpoint
export ANTHROPIC_TARGET_API_URL=https://litellm.company.internal

```

## Running in Production

For production deployments:

```bash
# Use a process manager
pip install gunicorn

# Run with gunicorn — server.py has no module-level `app`; FastAPI is built
# by the create_app() factory, so gunicorn needs --factory
gunicorn headroom.proxy.server:create_app \
  --workers 4 \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:8787 \
  --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \
  --factory
```

Or with Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential \
    && pip install "headroom-ai[proxy]" \
    && apt-get purge -y build-essential && apt-get autoremove -y \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
EXPOSE 8787
CMD ["headroom", "proxy", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```

> **Note:** `build-essential` is required at install time because `headroom-ai` includes `hnswlib`, a C++ extension that must be compiled from source. It is removed after installation to keep the image slim.
